### [Low-01] Admin can brick all queued withdrawals by changing strategy

**Description**

The `BaseVault` contract transfers vault shares to the current strategy's address when user queue withdrawals through `queuewithdrawal()` function. But if the strategy is changed through `setStrategy()`, the new strategy does not receive these shares and the old strategy retains them.

When the new strategy calls `executeQueuedWithdrawals()`, it attempts to burn shares from its own address which holds none, causing the transaction to revert. This design flaw breaks the queued withdrawal mechanism after a strategy change leaving users unable to withdraw their queued withdrawals

```solidity
//code snippets

function queueWithdrawal(uint256 shares, address recipient) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, address(strategy), shares); // Shares sent to strategy
    // ... records withdrawal ...
}

function executeQueuedWithdrawals() {
    // Only callable by current strategy
    _burn(address(strategy), totalQueuedShares); // @audit - fails if shares aren't here!
}
```

**Recommendation**

To fix this, track queued shares internally within the vault instead of transferring them to the strategy. This decouples share management from the strategyâ€™s address, ensuring that strategy changes do not disrupt the withdrawal process
