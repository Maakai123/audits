### [Critical-01] Incorrect isToken0 Parameter in exact_output_tokens1_swap Function Leading to Price Calculation Error

**Description**

The exact_output_tokens1_swap function contains a critical bug where it incorrectly passes true as the isToken0 parameter to library::get_amounts_in, when it should pass false. This function is designed to handle token1→token0 swaps (input token1, output token0), but the incorrect parameter causes it to use the wrong reserve ordering for price calculations.

=> Buggy Code

// Line 437 in sources/router.move

```rust
let amount_in_required = library::get_amounts_in(factory, amount_out, pair, false);
The library::get_amounts_in function uses the isToken0 parameter to determine reserve ordering:

let (reserve_in, reserve_out) = if (isToken0) {
    (reserve1, reserve0) // token1 -> token0 (since we want input amount)
} else {
    (reserve0, reserve1) // token0 -> token1 (since we want input amount)
};
```
Since exact_output_tokens1_swap handles token1 → token0 swaps, it should use isToken0=false to get the correct (reserve0, reserve1) ordering. However, it incorrectly uses isToken0=true, causing it to use (reserve1, reserve0) ordering, which is backwards.

**IMPACT**
User Losses: Users performing exact output swaps with token1 input pay significantly more

Protocol Losses: Incorrect pricing undermines protocol integrity and competitiveness
This vulnerability represents a critical security flaw that enables systematic economic exploitation. The bug causes incorrect pricing calculations for token1→token0 exact output swaps, leading to users paying 36-75% more than they should. The vulnerability is easily exploitable, persistent until fixed, and poses significant financial risk to users and the protocol.




### [Critical-02] Critical Access Control Bypass in Victory Token Minting Functions
https://dashboard.hackenproof.com/user/reports/SUIDEXCA-80

**Description**

The Victory Token contract implements two minting functions with fundamentally inconsistent access control mechanisms, creating a critical security vulnerability that allows unlimited token minting without any authorization.

Vulnerable Implementation: mint_for_farm() Function

// NO ACCESS CONTROL

```rust
public fun mint_for_farm(
    wrapper: &mut TreasuryCapWrapper,
    amount: u64,
    recipient: address,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    let coins = coin::mint(&mut wrapper.cap, amount, ctx);
    transfer::public_transfer(coins, recipient);
    // ... event emission
}
```
Access Control Disparity:

mint(): Requires MinterCap capability for authorization
mint_for_farm(): No access control mechanism whatsoever Base on the above any module can execute the function without restrictions, they can -Mint massive token supplies to crash market value.
Mint tokens to any address without consent

### [Critical-03] Constant Product Invariant Violation - Systematic Pool Value Reduction
https://dashboard.hackenproof.com/user/reports/SUIDEXCA-47

**Description**


The DEX implementation contains a critical mathematical flaw in the verify_k function that violates the fundamental constant product invariant (k = x * y) of Automated Market Makers. The function uses assert!(k1 >= k2) which allows the new k-value to be less than the original, enabling systematic value extraction from the liquidity pool with each transaction.

In standard AMM implementations, the constant product should never decrease during swaps (only increase due to fees remaining in the pool). This violation, combined with fee extraction, creates a mechanism where the pool loses value with every trade, systematically reducing returns for liquidity providers

Mathematical Proof of Violation

Scenario: Swap 1000 tokens with 0.3% fee

Before Swap:

Reserve0: 100,000 tokens
Reserve1: 100,000 tokens
k1 = 100,000 × 100,000 = 10,000,000,000
After Fee Extraction:

3 tokens (0.3%) removed from pool and sent to external addresses
Effective input: 997 tokens
New reserves: ~100,997 × ~99,003
k2 = 100,997 × 99,003 ≈ 9,999,700,091

Result: k2 < k1 (pool value decreased by ~299,909)

**Impact**

With 0.3% fee extraction per swap, pool value decreases by ~0.3% per transaction
High-volume trading accelerates pool value degradation
Eventually leads to pool insolvency

Pool loses value with each transaction
Enables arbitrage opportunities against the pool
Violates core AMM security assumptions






### [High-01] Critical Amount Misallocation in `add_liquidity` Due to Inconsistent Token Sorting Logic in Router.move
https://dashboard.hackenproof.com/user/reports/SUIDEXCA-71

**Description**
A critical vulnerability exists in the add_liquidity function within sources/router.move at lines 145-160. The router incorrectly applies token sorting logic, causing 100% amount misallocation when adding liquidity to token pairs where the alphabetical token order differs from the function call parameter order.

The vulnerability stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how token pairs work in the AMM system:

Factory Sorting: The factory uses alphabetical sorting to create canonical token pairs for storage and lookup purposes

Pair Structure: Pair<T0, T1> objects expect token amounts in the order of their generic type parameters (T0 first, T1 second), regardless of alphabetical ordering

**IMPACT**
100% amount misallocation for affected token pairs
Direct financial loss to liquidity providers who receive incorrect token ratios
Core AMM functionality compromise affecting system integrity



### [High-02] Liquidity Provider Fee Diversion - Complete Elimination of LP Trading Rewards
https://dashboard.hackenproof.com/user/reports/SUIDEXCA-44

**Description**
The DEX implementation contains a critical fee structure flaw where 100% of trading fees are diverted to external addresses (team, locker, buyback) instead of compensating liquidity providers. Despite defining an LP_FEE constant of 0.15%,the implementation completely ignores this value and sends all fees to external parties, violating the fundamental AMM economic model where LPs earn trading fees as compensation for providing liquidity and bearing impermanent loss risk.


**IMPACT**
This creates an economically unsustainable system where LPs provide capital but receive zero trading rewards, leading to inevitable liquidity drain.LPs do not receive direct fee rewards, which contrasts with standard AMMs where fees enhance pool reserves and LP returns.
